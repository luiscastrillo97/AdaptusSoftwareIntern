# AdaptusSoftwareIntern

The tasks.js module is based on the original template provided by Adaptus LLC with all the required logic. The s3_driver.js module was created to simulate the behavior of the imaginary module described in step 4. Finally, the test.js module was created to test the performance of the tasks.js module logic.

## How to run test.js

```
git clone https://github.com/luiscastrillo97/AdaptusSoftwareIntern.git

cd AdaptusSoftwareIntern

node test.js
```
